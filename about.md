Software Crafter, I take every opportunity to hone my skills and master my craft.
I thrive to ["defend and preserve the honor of the profession of computer programmers"](http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2015/11/18/TheProgrammersOath.html).

I came late to programming; I had my _own_ first computer when I was over 20.
I worked as a consultant in various projects ranging from large integrated enterprise software (such SAP and Oracle Applications) to small single purpose websites. 
I have been attracted to the technical side of software after working on data migration projects and I decided to retrain and learn how to write computer programs. I had the chance to be able to undertake an eleven months software development course in France where I learned how to code with Java.

Joining Codurance in May 2016, I was given the opportunity to level up my engineering skills and fully embrace the values of software craftsmanship. 
As a skilled professional I aim at delivering value by building resilient software.
